          <h2>About the Artist</h2>
          <p>
            After years of putting art on the backburner for college,
            parenthood, and work, COVID hit. This downtime was just what I
            needed to reignite my passion for art. It started as just sketching
            and then I decided I would take a shot at watercolors. To be honest,
            it was intimidating because painting was always a struggle for me.
            Little did I know that I would fall in love with it, and it has
            become one of the most therapeutic parts of my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began by taking inspiration from artwork I had seen in tattoo
            studios. I watched YouTube videos and read articles on techniques.
            The first dozen or so paintings looked as if a child had painted
            them. I stayed disciplined and just kept chipping away at it. I'd
            practice one technique for days until it felt comfortable and move
            on to the next. Slowly progressing and seeing the shift.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, my interests shifted from the American tattoo style to
            the beauty of Japanese-style woodblock prints. I've spent many hours
            and days working on recreating the style of Edo-era art with a
            modern spin. Taking influence from what got me into painting and
            merging it with the ancient style. Now I have many pieces and have
            even made art for bands, but mostly for myself and the people I care
            about.
